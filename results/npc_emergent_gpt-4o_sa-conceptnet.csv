Relevant concepts related to a shark being out of place might include contexts or settings where a shark is unusual or unexpected. For example, ""forest"" is a setting where a shark would be out of place. However, ""forest"" itself doesn\'t imply ""out of place"" on its own. Therefore, ""forest"" can serve as a suitable modifier.\n\n{""combination"": ""forest shark"", ""modifier"": ""forest""}']","{'combination': 'city shark', 'modifier': 'city'}",city shark,city,0.8888888888888888,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333,0.5555555555555556,"{'combination': 'forest shark', 'modifier': 'forest'}",forest shark,forest,1.0,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.8888888888888888,"{'combination': 'forest shark', 'modifier': 'forest'}",forest shark,forest,1.0,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.8888888888888888

""piece of clothing"": This concept relates to ""sweater"" and remains applicable to the combination ""a sweater on a dog,"" as the sweater does not lose its identity as clothing when worn by a dog.\n\n2.

When on a dog, the function of warmth is still present, so this property does not get canceled.\n\n- Fashion: A sweater can be considered a fashion item for humans.

A modifier that might fit the criteria is ""cave-dwelling"" doesn\'t seem to work, and flying can be replaced with ""indoor"". However, ""indoor"" bat is not unpleasant inherently.\n\nAnother combination could be a ""diseased"" bat, but ""diseased"" directly elicit the property ""unpleasant"". To represent diseased bat, ""rabid"" can be used as a modifier. But ""rabid"" is somewhat related to unpleasant because of its meaning. \n\nTo represent ""diseased"" bat, ""infected"" can be used as a modifier.

The modifier ""frozen"" does not inherently have the emergent property ""unpleasant,"" but when paired with ""bat,"" it could suggest an unpleasant state, especially if the bat is frozen in an unnatural position or environment.\n\nSo the answer is {""combination"": ""frozen bat"", ""modifier"": ""frozen""}']","['To generate a conceptual combination for the head noun ""bat"" with the emergent property ""unpleasant,"" I will consider the given relevant concepts.

One possible combination could be related to its habits. Bats are often found in dark places like caves. We can use ""cave"" as a modifier, but it\'s more of a location than a property. \n\nAnother approach is to consider the appearance of a bat. Bats have a unique appearance with their wings.

A ""punch"" typically involves a closed fist, which is related to the concept ""make fist."" However, when we consider the combination ""a punch in the stomach,"" the location of the punch (in the stomach) is specified, but the act of punching itself still involves a closed fist.\n\nNow, let\'s analyze the relevant concepts. ""Hurt"" is a likely outcome of a punch, but it\'s not a property that\'s canceled in the combination. ""Make fist"" is a property of the act of punching, but it\'s not necessarily canceled in the combination ""a punch in the stomach.""\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, we can consider the fact that a punch can be thrown at various locations on the body, but when it\'s specified as ""in the stomach,"" it implies a certain level of precision or targeting.

However, this property does not apply to the legendary or metaphorical ""pot of gold,"" which is more about wealth and not comfort.\n\nTherefore, a property that could be canceled in the combination ""the pot of gold"" is ""soft"" since it could apply to a ""pot"" (e.g., soft food in a pot) but not to ""the pot of gold"" in its metaphorical sense.\n\n{""property"": ""soft""}']","['To solve this problem, we need to identify a property that is inherent to one of the individual components, either ""the pot"" or ""gold,"" but does not apply to the combination ""the pot of gold.""\n\n1.

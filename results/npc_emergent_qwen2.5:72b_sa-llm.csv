For example, a shark in a desert or a forest would be considered out of place. However, using modifiers like ""desert"" or ""forest"" might be too direct and could imply the emergent property on their own.\n\nA more subtle approach is to use a modifier that suggests an environment where water is not typically present but can still evoke the idea of being out of place without directly implying it. One such modifier is ""land-locked.""\n\n### Reasoning:\n- ""Land-locked"" does not inherently mean ""out of place.""\n- When combined with ""shark,"" ""land-locked shark"" clearly suggests a shark in an environment where it should not be, thus exhibiting the emergent property ""out of place.""\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{""combination"": ""land-locked shark"", ""modifier"": ""land-locked""}']","{'combination': 'land shark', 'modifier': 'land'}",land shark,land,0.8888888888888888,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.7777777777777777,"{'combination': 'urban shark', 'modifier': 'urban'}",urban shark,urban,0.8888888888888888,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333,0.5555555555555556,"{'combination': 'land-locked shark', 'modifier': 'land-locked'}",land-locked shark,land,1.0,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.8888888888888888

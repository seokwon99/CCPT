But ""still"" can be a property of ""sleeper"" individually.\n\nConsidering all the above points, I will choose the emergent property as ""relaxed"", because the breast of a sleeper is in a relaxed state due to the person\'s sleep. However, ""relaxed"" can also describe the ""sleeper"" individually.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can conclude that the emergent property of ""the breast of a sleeper"" is ""exposed"".
